# The Flower Garden - A Casual Creator
A casual creator created using the Processing language. 

## Brain Storm 
1. What are your users casually creating? 

    - My users are casually creating a suspended flower garden. This includes the stems and fallen petals of the flower. 

2. How do you keep them engaged and excited to create? 

    - I keep the users engaged using color changing elements as well as providing the user fome time to interact with the flowers before the fall to the bottom of the screen. 

3. How do you help them make something they are proud to share?

    - I help the user make something they are proud to share by providing the user the basic elements neccessary for the creation of a flower while allowing them to arrange the flowers on their own and with their own conviction. 

4. Sketch of goal for the end result.

## Why is this system meaningful to me?

My mother's birthday is approaching and I wanted to buy her some flowers; however, I unfortunately do not have a car or a driver's license. My mother is also deathly allergic to bees and I do not want to risk having flowers delivered that may contain bees or attract bees to our home. My hopes in creating this casual creator is to gift my mother virtual flowers on her birthday. These flowers will certainly not harm her and will be viewable until the end of time. 

## Challenges 
This system has challenged me to think of different representations of a very common natural item. The comlexities of flowers are difficult to emulate given the subtleties of the wrinkles on the petals or the leaves on the stems. I also wanted to capture the delicacy of flowers and how they interact with gravity and the space around them. For example, if you touch a petal of a flower in the real work, the petals will either fall off or change in some manner ot fit the shape of the item it came into contact with. 

In order to push myself out of my comfort zone, I am coding the flowers using classes. Object oriented representation and the interactions between classes are both coding challenges for me. Given that my flower garden or flower mosaic is made entirely of classes, I am trying to move beyond these weaknesses and turn them into strengths. This is an important challenge for me because understading OOP will help me gain better grasp on othe computer science concepts such as inheritance and implementation. 

The next steps for me going forward is to try to add even more details to the flowers and to implement a flower counter that can present to the user how many flowers they created within a sessiona nd how many flowers have ever been created using my casual creator.
